See https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/BugReporting for details on bug reports first!

* Please don't "report" questions as bugs

Found a bug? - We would like to help you and smash the bug away.

1. Before reporting a bug have a look into our issue tracker to see if the bug was already reported and you can add some additional information.
1. If it's a new bug - create a new issue.
 
 To save time and help us identify the issue a bug report should at least contain the following:

    *  an useful description of the bug - "It's not working" isn't good enough - you must try harder ;)
    * the steps to reproduce the bug
    * command line you have used
    * to what system did you connect to? (win8, 2008, ..)
    * what did you expect to happen?
    * what actually happened?
    * freerdp version (e.g. xfreerdp --version) or package version or git commit
    * freerdp configuration (e.g. xfreerdp --buildconfig)
    * operating System, architecture, distribution e.g. linux, amd64, debian
    * if you built it yourself add some notes which branch you have used, also your cmake parameters can help
    * extra information helping us to find the bug

* If you have question join us in irc (#freerdp on freenode) or write a mail to our mailing list.

Thank you for reporting a bug!
